About the Software
------------------
Rename It is a simple gui based python program created using Tkinter module
If you are Movie/Anime/Tv Show Fanatic like me, its no brainer that you have a whole bunch of movie/anime collections.
When you buy/download the episodes, you might have realised they come with website or Bluray name...
Its quite annoyning when you try to rename 'em individually, its time consuming too...
This Software enables you to rename 'em within seconds...

Hopefully, you will enjoy our Product...
Samrat Family Thanks You !
