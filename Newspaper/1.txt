Naruto and Luffy are two of my all time fav anime characters. 
Apparently, they were both inspired by Akira's Goku from Dragon Ball Franchise.
They are both goofy and stupid and hence are interesting.
They both share some similarities...
Naruto is the son of Minato Namikage the 4th hokage, 
one of the most powerful shinobi of the Naruto world, respected my even his foes
Luffy is the son of  Monkey D. Dragon, 
the most Wanted Man in the One Piece world. Only little is known about him.
